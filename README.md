This project creates a  a static (front-end only) website for a band to promote their back catalog, and any new material as it becomes available to existing and new fans.
The site also showcases their music and publicises their availability to perform at events such as weddings and Christmas parties.
Links are provided to their social media pages; Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.
Strategy: In relation to  the strategy, all assets supplied, which provide the content, are useful in targeting a variety of users. Thus the  target group is all music lovers which includes both business and general consumer. From a consumer perspective the site is presented in such a way as to primarily target new fans as existing fans are well familiar with the brand.
From a business perspective there is a desire and potential to attract music promoters and corporate businesses to hire the band for events.
The music industry has adapted very well to digital technology and thus there are no technological issues envisaged
The business goal is also quite straightforward. Promote the brand while maintaining  the existing fan base and developing a new one. With the younger generation being reared on internet and mobile phone technology, establishing new fans is a mere click away, particularly as the site will feature iconic tunes and images that appeal to emotions.                               
The primary consideration is simple content both catchy and compelling for potential fans with underlying content to entice business users and keep existing fans updated.
Scope:
AS outlined above simple content using iconic images and tunes is preferred to avoid scope creep and to focus the user. The desire is to make the decision for them.
The content is mixed and uses text, images and video and audio files.
Elements are sized to inform and entice.
Structure:
The intention is to create meaningful relationships as the user navigates the site. Main navigation elements are provided conventionally (horizontally close to the top of the page) and remain consistent throughout in form and function. They allow allows users to efficiently move through content. Familiarity is induced by keeping styles stable and consistent. Information is grouped into familar categories and in general fits the page with minimal scrolling. 
Large single click objects that perform  a colour change on action inform the user as to what is going on and information is provided in a clear assured manner. There are no dead links. Where links are not established yet  the user is directed to a new tab page with a message. 
The simple minimalistic page structure facilitates a mobile first approach while ensuring there is scope for growth and change to allow the site to evolve as more content becomes available.
Skeleton:
The users navigate through the site through navigation menus, links and buttons. Navigation remains familiar throughout  to cultivate familiarity and to promote a positive user friendly experience. Specific content is further built on through the specific link and progressive disclosure in conjunction with similar expression of similar parts, ensures consistent perception throughout the site. Order is preserved. The information is revealed across a number of pages through the use of simple features and minimal clicks. Navigation is enhanced through the use of representational icons that are conventional and visible.  Being familiar objects they are easily understood and provide clear meaning to all users. Similar icons on different pages induce the same positive user experience. 
Pencil wireframe was used to plot a two-dimensional model of the perceived end product. These static diagrams represented the content, navigations and interactions in a meaningful visual format.
Surface: 
The surface pulls together layout, typography, colors, images, fonts and reveals the order and sequence of the site. The consistency of the patterns are recognised as are the contrast in fonts, sizes and colours. 5 pages are provided along with two additional pdfs that open in a new tab.
The clients being entertainers have influenced the choice of layout and colors. An artistic look has been created through a minimalistic approach with light background colours and contrasting reddish font colours and some black text. It is inspired from the bands previous incarnation as comic book characters in the late sixties.  The brand image chosen is one of their comic book images and thus sets the tone for the whole product. The features and elements float in space and are defined by their very presence in this space. The user is drawn to the feature floating in space.
The mimialistic approach and simplicity of features ensures that the user is not overloaded and distracted from the purpose of the product, which is to disseminate information on the band and raise their profile. In addition it allows scope for addition of information within the current structure, when more information becomes available, if so desired. 
The rule of thirds is evident with the structure of header, section and footer roughly taking up a third of the height respectively.  The iconic logo is placed in the top left third of the header. Clicking on this logo will always take you to the home page, which is an accepted convention. Transisitions have been kept to a minimum. A simple transisition has been applied to the logo image, using a hover effect which has been further enhanced by applying some further css styling. The image comes toward you to greet you on hover and it is complemented by the slogan taking up the two thirds header space to the right. The header slogan is a direct quote from the signature tune of the band. This is the first element of the branding to introduce the band. 
The navigation menu always sits  in the bottom two thirds of the header section across the whole product. There is a simple pulse animation on each item in the menu representing  beats of musical notes in keeping with the artistic theme. There is also a conventional icon for each item as well as a colour change on hover indicating that an action (click) can occur.
The navigation menu while consistent in appearance does have a subtle change to the content across each page. For example when in the about page, a menu link to this page is not necessary, so the about link is changed with a link to the gallery page and so on. This means that all pages are accessible from the current page with just one click. 
The header section is consistent across all pages in form with the footer consistent across the first three pages. Some familiarity of the footer is retained for the final two pages.
The footer contains two call to actions. A button to inquire on hiring  and a button to receive information on the band and products. These buttons are actually links disguised as buttons and are identical to the submit buttons on the contact page. The links to social media are also contained in the footer.  Again all buttons and links remain familiar across the site in form colour and function. The one exception is in the contact page where visually, the social links are changed to match the form of the navigation menu. The icons and text still clearly define the intent and thus the function has not changed. This change works well in the contact page where more footer space permits use of larger type elements that entice the user to click and discover more. It sits horizontally as normal on mobile type devices but with the use of a media query, floats vertically in space like a sidebar, on larger screen sizes.
The mid section of the home page is subtely darkened to reveal a separate section, being the second third in a horizontal context. A video of one of their best sellers sits in the left third of the section beneath the logo-image. This is complemented further right by a branding message, including a second line from their signature song. Finally in this mid section, two buttons invite the user to sample some tunes and view some images. These custom buttons are actually links but  the use of a button class allows better styling to give more definition and to blend in with the theme. This completes the branding aspect of the band.
The About page is very similar to the home page with the exception of the middle section which now contains some information about the band. A publicity image of the band  replaces the video with information on the band to the right. A link to view the gallery is provided below the image. Again the mid section of the About page is subtely darkened to define a separate section. A download icon with instructions facilitates a link to a wikipedia file with more information about the band, which, includes history, discography and bibliography.
The Songs page is also very similar to the home page with the exception of the middle section, now dominated by the available audio tracks which fill the entire mid section. The audio control bar fits under a large album image. There is little distraction here, just click and listen.
The contact page keeps the same header section as the previous pages. The mid section is taken up by a publicity image occupying the first third and the available for hire form which takes up the remaining two thirds to the right. There is no footer on this page. The section is continued with the request for information form in the first two thirds and the social links bar in the last third.
The gallery page maintains the same consistent header, while the labelled images dominate the rest of the page.  The social links menu sits at the bottom of the gallery.
Developer perspective:
HTML and CSS have been used to produce the site. No JavaScript has been employed at this point. Bootstrap, fontawesome, hover.css and some google fonts have been used to enhance the product and reduce the amount of styling to be coded. Some flexbox layout has also been used where appropriate. Bootstrap and flexbox easily cater for a design responsive approach where the emphasis is designing for a mobile first approach. Many elements have been repeated meaning that blocks of code can be reused resulting in efficiencies in coding and development.
Semantic elements such as <form>, <button>, <article>, <header> and <section> are used throughout  to enable content to be better defined. In addition class names are applied extensively to further define elements and facilitate style targetting. The span element while non-semantic is used on a few occasions to help style target an inline item. Comments are also used within the html and css pages to further signify what elements are involved.
The bootstrap grid system is used for most of the site facilitating a mobile first approach. Rows are placed within a full width container (container-fluid) to facilitate proper alignment and padding. The rows also enable the creation of horizontal groups of columns and this is useful when designing layout to the rule of  thirds. Some typography from bootstrap is  employed such as <mark>,  text-uppercase and text-center. The list-inline class is used to list the navigation menu items and the social media links. Clearfix is used in conjunction with inline ellements to clear any potentially floated content.
The bootstrap img-responsive class is used for the image in the header and the images on the about and contact pages.  This minimises the need for styling of these images. The img-circle class was used in the gallery to give a portrait look to the individual band member images.
Other properties such as max-width: 100%; height: auto; display: block; and center-block are all used to centrally position other images and blocks of media files and text.
The button classes btn-success and  btn-info are used in conjunction with the forms (enquire about hiring and request info respectively), representing conventional colours that are recognisable. A btn-custom class is used for the links on the home page, so they can be styled in the general theme of the site.  A btn-sm class is used for the link to the gallery. This button class facilitates a block of colour on hover.
