This project creates a  a static (front-end only) website for a band to promote their back catalog, and any new material as it becomes available to existing and new fans.
The site also showcases their music and publicises their availability to perform at events such as weddings and Christmas parties.
Links are provided to their social media pages; Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.
Strategy: In relation to  the strategy, all assets supplied, which provide the content,  are useful in targeting a variety of users. Thus the  target group is all music lovers which includes both business and general consumer. From a consumer perspective the site is presented in such a way as to primarily target new fans as existing fans are well familiar with the brand.
From a business perspective there is a desire and potential to attract music promoters and corporate businesses to hire the band for events.
The music industry has adapted very well to digital technology and thus there are no technological issues envisaged
The business goal is also quite straightforward. Promote the brand while maintaining  the existing fan base and developing a new one. With the younger generation being reared on internet and mobile phone technology, establishing new fans is a mere click away, particularly as the site will feature iconic tunes and images that appeal to emotions.                               
The primary consideration is simple content both catchy and compelling for potential fans with underlying content to entice business users and keep existing fans updated.
Scope:
AS outlined above simple content using iconic images and tunes is preferred to avoid scope creep and to focus the user. The desire is to make the decision for them.
The content is mixed and uses text, images and video and audio files.
Elements are sized to inform and entice.
Structure:
The intention is to create meaningful relationships as the user navigates the site. Main navigation elements are provided conventionally (horizontally close to the top of the page) and remain consistent throughout in form and function. They allow allows users to efficiently move through content. Familiarity is induced by keeping styles stable and consistent. Information is grouped into familar categories and in general fits the page with minimal scrolling. 
Large single click objects that perform  a colour change on action inform the user as to what is going on and information is provided in a clear assured manner. There are no dead links. Where links are not established yet  the user is directed to a new tab page with a message. 
The simple minimalistic page structure facilitates a mobile first approach while ensuring there is scope for growth and change to allow the site to evolve as more content becomes available.
